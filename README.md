Name of the game  :  Adventure Game

My game contains 6 rooms. The entry Hall, the dining room, the library, the kitchen, the study room, and the garden.

If the player wants to move from room to room, he will be clicking on the directional buttons indicating east, west, north, or south. 

The directional button appears only if there is a room in the respective direction. 

The main screen of my game will contain an exit button that will help the player to exit the application and return to the main screen of the phone. 

Each room will have a description, and some hints to guide the player in determining which room he is about to enter.
